                <p>ATTA is a website that features a few of my favorite artists and their 
                  most well-known masterpieces. Going through the site will be like a travel 
                  through time because each piece of art could be associated to a particular 
                  time frame. The goal of this is to introduce and educate people not 
                  interested with art, to the classics, and to hopefully raise interest 
                  among the visitors of my site. Ever since my youth, I've always loved art, 
                  and I wish to ignite the passion of many to art through this website.</p>
